            <h2>Welcome to the new world of Book My Trip!</h2>
            
            <p class="long-copy">
                Let me first begin with the inception of this concept. For a long time, I was watching a generation of unemployed youth who had no idea what to do with their future. They had no resources to whom to and did have the slightest clue as to how to improve their future. I shared this concern of mine with my fellow colleagues and friends. And from this discussion, the idea of travel agency gained momentum and book my trip was born. In the beginning, the operations started in Belgaum. The people in Beigaum and nearby areas gave them a tremendous response. They made possible to create commendable numbers of bookings. Today book my trip is operational in Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

In our busy lives, every soul is searching for something. We all are in quest of happiness and contentment. Some find bliss in the arms of loved ones and some find it in snowclad mountains bathed with the beauty of nature. Some seek solace in solitude and some in friends. Whatever may be our channels of happiness; we all are seeking to quench our thirst. Life is a long journey and everyone is searching for the ultimate happiness. Happiness is all around us… it’s in the first light of day, in a newborn’s face. All we need is the vision to see this happiness scattered around us for us to grab it.
Travel is not just seeing places. It’s about soaking the inherent beauty of the place and its people. Travel inspires. A nomad seeks happiness in search of roads less travelled. Life is a long journey and every road; every destination is full of experiences. Let’s walk together to these lands of bliss and contentment and make our lives richer than before.
Happy journey!
